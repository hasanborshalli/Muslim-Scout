        <p>As much as Beirut was the banner of modernity at the beginning of the century full of ideas and slogans. The Muslim Scout was at the vant-garde in spreading the Scout movement in our entire Arab environment... Since 1912, the flame of the Muslim Scout Association has been slaming. Its message bears distinguished leaders and educators, who put the interest of young people and its reform in their eyes, so they did not spare effort or sacrifice in order to achieve the goals of the association at all levels. Leader Dr. Mohammed Khair Al-Qadi, Secretary of the Muslim Scout Association in Lebanon</p>
